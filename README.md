# Technical-Paper
This repository contains Adamnite's technical paper. This is analogous to similar technical specifications (namely Ethereum's Yellow Paper), and contains a formal specification for the Adamnite Protocol. You can find Latex and PDF versions in the files above. The technical paper is still a work in progress and will be updated periodically as the Adamnite Protocol evolves. Namely, a thorough appendix that provides additional context for the specifications described in the paper will be added, and additional details on Adamnite's programming environment will be added once it has become more formalized. This is a public work under the Creative Commons licence.
